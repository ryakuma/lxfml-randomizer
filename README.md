# lxfml-randomizer
Randomizes LEGO Digital Designer model (LXFML) file

ToDo: Generate blocks one unit higher also when it is on another's block "hitbox", this would stop blocks from being removed due to collision problems.

Usage: Start the program, enter block amount, field size, your file will be generated as "randomized.lxfml".

Field size is length of a side of a square in which blocks are generated.
i.e. Field size = 10 -> field in Digital Designer is -5 to 5
